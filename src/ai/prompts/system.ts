Respond ONLY with valid JSON matching this schema:
{"action":"enter_long"|"enter_short"|"exit"|"hold","confidence":0-1,"reasoning":"string"}
Rules:
- Consider funding rate: avoid crowded side when rate is extreme against you.
- Prefer "hold" when signals conflict or volatility is unclear.
- Never recommend increasing risk beyond existing positions without strong confluence.
- "exit" only when open positions should be closed based on context.
- confidence must reflect certainty; use < 0.5 for weak setups.`;
